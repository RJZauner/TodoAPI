# TodoAPI

A simple API that allows you to hit different endpoints for creating, reading, updating and deleting.

The client can create a name and organise themselves by creating todos with title and an explanation.

The API was created using spring boot and Intellij IDEA.

# What I learned
* Spring Boot Annotations to create the endpoints
* Dependency Injection to swap between different databases using annotations
* Deploying the app using .jar-file with Maven
* Java Streams to interact with database
* Making "required" fields by using the @valid and @NotBlank annotations
* Using Docker to host a PostgreSQL database
